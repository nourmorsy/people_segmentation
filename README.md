# People Segmentation

## Overview
This project focuses on segmenting people within images using advanced image processing and deep learning techniques. The goal is to create a model that can accurately identify and separate people from the background, useful in applications like photo editing, augmented reality, and automated content creation.

## Dependencies
To run this project, ensure the following dependencies are installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `opencv-python`
  - `tensorflow` or `pytorch` (depending on the framework used)
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-image`

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy opencv-python tensorflow matplotlib scikit-image
```

## Files

- **people_segmentation.ipynb**: Main Jupyter Notebook containing code for loading images, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Follow the cells in this notebook to execute each step of the segmentation pipeline.
